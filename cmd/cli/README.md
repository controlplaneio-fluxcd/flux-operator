# Flux Operator CLI

The Flux Operator CLI is a command line tool that allows you to manage the Flux Operator resources
in your Kubernetes clusters. It provides a convenient way to interact with the operator
and perform various operations.

## Installation

The Flux Operator CLI is available as a binary executable for Linux, macOS, and Windows. The binaries
can be downloaded from GitHub [releases page](https://github.com/controlplaneio-fluxcd/flux-operator/releases).

If you are using macOS or Linux, you can install the CLI using Homebrew:

```shell
brew install controlplaneio-fluxcd/tap/flux-operator
```

To configure your shell to load `flux-operator` Bash completions add to your profile:

```shell
echo "source <(flux-operator completion bash)" >> ~/.bash_profile
```

Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell are also supported with their own sub-commands.

### Container Image

The Flux Operator CLI is also available as a container image, which can be used in CI pipelines
or Kubernetes Jobs. The image contains the `flux-operator` CLI binary and the `kubectl` binary.

The multi-arch image (Linux AMD64/ARM64) is hosted on GitHub Container Registry at
`ghcr.io/controlplaneio-fluxcd/flux-operator-cli`.

```shell
version=$(gh release view --repo controlplaneio-fluxcd/flux-operator --json tagName -q '.tagName')
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint=flux-operator ghcr.io/controlplaneio-fluxcd/flux-operator-cli:$version help
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint=kubectl ghcr.io/controlplaneio-fluxcd/flux-operator-cli:$version help
```

## Commands

The Flux Operator CLI provides commands to manage the Flux Operator resources.
Except for the `build` commands, all others require access to the Kubernetes cluster
and the Flux Operator to be installed.

The CLI connects to the cluster using the `~.kube/config` file, similar to `kubectl`.

All commands display help information and example usage when run with the `-h` or `--help` flag.

### Build Commands

### Install Command

The `flux-operator install` command provides a quick way to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster with the Flux Operator and a Flux instance.

This command performs the following steps:

2. Installs the Flux Operator in the `flux-system` namespace and waits for it to become ready.
3. Installs the Flux instance in the `flux-system` namespace according to the provided configuration.
4. Configures the pull secret for the instance sync source if credentials are provided.
5. Configures Flux to bootstrap the cluster from a Git repository or OCI repository if a sync URL is provided.
6. Configures automatic updates of the Flux Operator from the distribution artifact.
